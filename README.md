A JS Library for a smooth Scroll on your Website


# Compatability

librarys e.g.:

The best part is, that it has support for animation libraries like: ScrollMagic or any other lib.

# How to use

or create a object with parameters:

let se = Scrollengine(element=window, strength=10, acceleration=1.2, deceleration=0.975);
